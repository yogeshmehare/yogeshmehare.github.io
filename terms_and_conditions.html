  <h1>Terms & Conditions — SweetSwan</h1>
  <p class="muted">Effective date: 2026-01-17</p>

  <p>These Terms & Conditions ("Terms") govern your use of the SweetSwan mobile application (the "App"). By downloading, installing or using the App you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the App.</p>

  <h2>1. Using the App</h2>
  <p>The App is a social discovery platform for consenting adults to create profiles, like other profiles, and message matched users. You must be at least 16 years old to use the App.</p>

  <h2>2. Account Responsibility</h2>
  <p>You are responsible for the information you share and for keeping your account credentials secure. We may suspend or terminate accounts that violate these Terms or our policies.</p>

  <h2>3. Acceptable Use</h2>
  <p>Do not use the App to harass, stalk, impersonate, send spam, solicit others, or engage in illegal activity. Respect other users’ rights and privacy.</p>

  <h2>4. Content & Interactions</h2>
  <p>Content you post (profile photos, bio, messages) may be visible to other users. You retain ownership of your content but grant SweetSwan a license to host and display it as necessary to provide the service.</p>

  <h2>5. Matches, Likes & Messaging</h2>
  <p>Matches are produced when both users like each other, enabling in-app messaging. We do not guarantee any matches or results — outcomes depend on user activity and preferences.</p>

  <h2>6. Payments & Subscriptions</h2>
  <p>Certain features may be provided under paid subscriptions. Purchases made through platform stores (Google Play, App Store) are subject to the store’s payment policies. Refunds are handled as per the store's policy.</p>

  <h2>7. Disclaimers & Limitations</h2>
  <p>The App is provided "as is" without warranties. We are not responsible for other users’ behavior or for any interactions that occur offline.</p>

  <h2>8. Termination</h2>
  <p>We may suspend or terminate your access if you breach these Terms or our policies. You can also delete your account in Settings.</p>

  <h2>9. Governing Law</h2>
  <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of the jurisdiction in which SweetSwan operates. For legal inquiries, contact the email below.</p>
