<h2>1. Eligibility</h2>

<li>You must be at least <strong>18 years old</strong> to create an account and use SweetSwan.</li>
<li>By using the App, you represent and warrant that you are at least 18 years of age and have the legal capacity to enter into these Terms.</li>
<li>We reserve the right to request proof of age at any time and to suspend or terminate accounts that violate this requirement.</li>
</ul>

<h2>2. Account Registration</h2>
<ul>
<li>You must register with a valid email address and create a secure password.</li>
<li>You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials.</li>
<li>You agree to provide accurate, current, and complete information during registration and onboarding (name, age, gender, photos, location).</li>
<li>You may not create more than one account or use another person's account.</li>
<li>We reserve the right to suspend or terminate accounts that contain false, misleading, or fraudulent information.</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Use of the Service</h2>

<h3>3.1 Permitted Use</h3>
<p>SweetSwan is a dating and social connection platform. You may use the App to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create and maintain a personal profile.</li>
<li>Discover, like, super-like, and match with other users.</li>
<li>Chat with mutual matches.</li>
<li>Purchase premium subscriptions for enhanced features.</li>
</ul>

<h3>3.2 Prohibited Conduct</h3>
<p>You agree <strong>not</strong> to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use the App for any unlawful purpose or to solicit illegal activity.</li>
<li>Harass, bully, stalk, intimidate, threaten, or abuse any user.</li>
<li>Post content that is hateful, discriminatory, sexually explicit, violent, or otherwise objectionable.</li>
<li>Upload photos that you do not own or have the right to use, or that depict minors.</li>
<li>Impersonate any person or entity, or misrepresent your identity, age, or affiliation.</li>

<li>Spam other users with unsolicited messages, commercial promotions, or advertisements.</li>
<li>Collect or harvest personal information of other users.</li>
<li>Share your account credentials with third parties.</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. Profile Content &amp; Photos</h2>
<ul>
<li>You retain ownership of the content you upload (photos, bio, etc.).</li>
<li>By uploading content, you grant SweetSwan a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free licence to use, display, and distribute your content within the App for the purpose of providing the Service.</li>
<li>You must only upload photos of yourself. Group photos, celebrity images, stock photos, and images of other people without their consent are not permitted.</li>
<li>We reserve the right to remove content that violates these Terms without prior notice.</li>
</ul>

<h2>5. Face Verification</h2>
<ul>
<li>SweetSwan offers an optional face verification feature to help build trust between users.</li>
<li>Verification involves taking a live selfie that is compared against your uploaded profile photos.</li>
<li>Face comparison is performed using secure processing; selfies are <strong>not</strong> permanently stored after the comparison is complete.</li>
<li>A "Verified" badge indicates that a user's selfie matched their profile photos at the time of verification. It does <strong>not</strong> constitute identity verification or a background check.</li>
<li>We do not guarantee the accuracy of face verification and are not responsible for any reliance placed upon the verified badge.</li>
</ul>

<h2>6. Location Services</h2>
<ul>
<li>SweetSwan uses your device's GPS to determine your location for the purpose of showing you nearby users and calculating approximate distances.</li>
<li>Your <strong>exact coordinates are never displayed</strong> to other users; only an approximate distance (e.g., "5 km away") is shown.</li>
<li>You may revoke location permission at any time via your device settings. Without location access, distance-based matching will be unavailable.</li>
<li>Premium "Travel Mode" allows Platinum subscribers to set a virtual location to discover users in other areas.</li>
</ul>

<h2>7. Camera &amp; Photo Library Access</h2>
<ul>
<li>The App requests <strong>camera access</strong> to capture profile photos and face-verification selfies directly within the App.</li>
<li>The App requests <strong>photo library / storage access</strong> to allow you to select existing photos from your device for your profile.</li>
<li>Photos are uploaded to our secure cloud storage and displayed to other users as part of your profile.</li>
<li>You may revoke camera and storage permissions at any time via your device settings.</li>
</ul>

<h2>8. Push Notifications</h2>
<ul>
<li>SweetSwan uses Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) to deliver push notifications about new matches, messages, likes, super likes, and profile views.</li>
<li>On Android 13 and above, notification permission is requested at runtime. You may grant or deny this permission.</li>
<li>You can manage notification preferences within the App (Settings → Notifications) or via your device's system settings.</li>
<li>Disabling notifications will not affect core functionality but you may miss time-sensitive updates about matches and messages.</li>
</ul>
